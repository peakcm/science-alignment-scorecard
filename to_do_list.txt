1. Revise methods for calculating and documenting scientific consensus.
	1a. Add a metric for how influential a certain source is
	1b. Document actual equation and methods
	1c. Specify which sources to look into, such as cochrane reviews, WHO, IPCC
2. Add a check for bias
	2a. Option 1 is to create a panel of statements/documents which have placeholders for the person's name.
		Run the analysis with a made up a name as well as with a real name and ensure the score is based on just the document (ie, should be equal)
	2b. can test head-to-head bias by taking a sample of some of the documents found, changing the name to the other candidate, and running the score. Should be equal if no bias drawn from outside that data point
	2c. Ask claude what bias detection and mitigation strategy to use
3. Add a database with each statement and link for each person
4. Remove democrat/republican tagline
5. Generalize beyond campaigns, to generally include public figures or even a company name
6. Add a general analysis summary on the chosen person/corporation. What's their score, how has it trended with time, etc
7. Allow user to enter a person or corporation name, then a statement of interest (or select from our list)
	7a. Flag when the topic is not scientific and consensus wouldn't make sense
8. explicitly cycle through specific sources, including statements on their website, quotes in print, quotes in podcasts, quotes in TV appearances
9. Add more caveats, banner saying this is experimental, using some mock data sources, a learning tool to practice coding tools, and does not reflect the opinions of any individual or organization
