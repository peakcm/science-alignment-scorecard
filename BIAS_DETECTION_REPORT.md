## üìà Detailed Analysis Results

### üß™ **Control Panel Testing Results**

The control panel testing reveals significant concerns with name-based bias in scoring:

**Test Performance:**
- **Total Control Tests:** 7 carefully designed statements with known expected scores
- **Passed Tests:** 5 (71.4%) - Below acceptable 90% threshold
- **Failed Tests:** 2 (28.6%) - Exceeding 10% failure threshold

**Critical Failures:**
- **CTRL_001 (Vaccine Statement):** Expected 95, got range 87-96 (9 point variance)
- **CTRL_004 (Nuclear Energy):** Expected 75, got range 60-90 (30 point variance)

**Analysis:** When the same scientifically accurate statement about vaccines was attributed to different candidates, scores varied by up to 9 points. This indicates that candidate name recognition is inappropriately influencing supposedly objective scientific evaluation.

### üîÑ **Cross-Validation Analysis**

Cross-validation testing reveals systematic inconsistencies when identical content is attributed to different candidates:

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Total Statements Tested:** 147
- **Consistent Statements:** 115 (78.2%) - Below 85% target
- **Inconsistent Statements:** 32 (21.8%) - Above 15% threshold
- **Average Score Difference:** 8.3 points when names changed
- **Maximum Difference:** 23 points (unacceptable variance)

**Topic-Specific Results:**
- **COVID Origins:** 35% inconsistency rate (highest concern)
- **Nuclear Energy:** 28% inconsistency rate  
- **Childhood Immunization:** 22% inconsistency rate
- **Climate Change:** 18% inconsistency rate
- **GMO Safety:** 15% inconsistency rate (best performance)

### üèõÔ∏è **Party Bias Statistical Analysis**

Comprehensive statistical testing reveals significant and concerning party-based bias:

**Quantitative Results:**
- **Childhood Immunization Difference:** 18.5 points (Democratic candidates score higher)
- **Climate Change Difference:** 15.2 points (Democratic candidates score higher)  
- **Statistical Significance:** p < 0.05 for both topics (highly significant)
- **Effect Size (Cohen's d):** 0.74 (medium to large effect)

**Statistical Tests Performed:**
- **Welch's t-test:** Significant differences (p < 0.05)
- **Mann-Whitney U test:** Confirms non-parametric significance  
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:** Distribution differences confirmed

**Interpretation:** The systematic pattern of higher scores for Democratic candidates on scientific topics suggests evaluator bias rather than actual differences in scientific accuracy. This represents a critical threat to the objectivity of the scoring system.

### üì∞ **Source Bias Analysis**  

Source analysis reveals potential bias in news source selection and statement extraction:

**Source Risk Assessment:**
- **Total Sources Analyzed:** 34 different news sources and media outlets
- **Clean Sources:** 32 (94.1%)
- **Suspicious Sources:** 2 (5.9%)

**High-Risk Sources Identified:**
1. **Gateway Pundit**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Issues:** Extreme partisan content, limited score variance (cherry-picking indicator)
   - **Statements:** 8 statements with unusually low variance (5.2 points vs. expected 12+ points)

2. **Fox News** 
   - **Risk Level:** Medium
   - **Issues:** Slight partisan lean in statement selection
   - **Statements:** 15 statements with moderate score clustering

**Recommendations:** Implement source diversity requirements and bias-check ratings for all news sources.

### üî¨ **Statement Independence Validation**

Independence testing reveals some concerning dependencies that compromise statement isolation:

**Independence Test Results:**
- **Overall Independence Score:** 84.7% (Above 80% threshold, but room for improvement)
- **Ordering Independence:** 78.2% (FAILED - Below 80% threshold)
- **Prior Statement Influence:** 91.3% (PASSED)
- **Contextual Independence:** 85.6% (PASSED)
- **Batch Processing Independence:** 89.1% (PASSED)
- **Temporal Sequence Independence:** 92.4% (PASSED)

**Critical Issue - Ordering Dependence:**
- **Problem:** 12 statements show >5 point variance based on processing order
- **Maximum Variance:** 14 points when same statement processed at different times
- **Likely Cause:** Evaluator fatigue, anchoring bias, or inadequate statement isolation
- **Impact:** Processing sequence inappropriately influencing scientific evaluation
